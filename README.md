# Switch2Deck

Tutorial and scripts setting up Nintendo Switch homebrew and emulation using
just the Steam Deck. I'll also include some tips and links.

---

## What you need

- Nintendo Switch, homebrew-able
- RCM-jig
- Steam Deck (RIP Q2+); but also this will apply to any if not all Linux
  machines
- USB-C **data** cable
- Enough storage space
- (optional) USB-C hub for desktop-mode convenience / or setup KDE Connect
  (see Tips)

## Step 1 - Steam Deck

I recommend going to the tips section to make interacting with your Deck's
desktop mode easier, as you might want a mouse and keyboard.

Downloads:

- [JTegraNX.jar](https://github.com/dylwedma11748/JTegraNX/releases/latest).
- [Adoptium JRE 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) or other JRE should
  be ok, this one can also be used and is recommended for PolyMC, a great
  Minecraft launcher.

### Running Java & JTegraNX

This is mostly where I'll differ from yuzu emulator team's instructions, the
rest should be the same regardless of platform.

## Step 2 - Homebrew

## Step 3 - Backups

## Step 4 - Emulation

## Tips

### KDE Connect

KDE Connect is a companion app for the KDE desktop environment which the Deck
uses. It has many features, one of which is the remote input. Depending on your
connection there may a bit of latency, but it's a good alternative if you don't
have a USB-C hub or haven't set up the Steam desktop controller bindings for
desktop use.

Follow [this great PSA by u/DevOpsIsAMindset](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/tb7h13/kde_connect_is_available_on_the_steam_deck/).

Once you have it set up on the Deck, get the app (all popular platforms
available) for your computer or phone set up as well, and pair the 2 devices.
